In this diagram, the Pricing Feed System is the system being developed, and it interacts with a CSV uploader and 
a database to upload and persist pricing feeds from retail stores. The CSV uploader reads CSV files that contain 
Store ID, SKU, Product Name, Price, and Date information and sends this data to the Pricing Feed System.
The Pricing Feed System then stores this data in a database for future use.

In this diagram, the Pricing Records System is the system being developed, and it interacts with a Search module, 
a Record Editor module, and a database. The Search module allows users to search for pricing records using various 
criteria, such as Store ID, SKU, Product Name, Price, and Date.The Record Editor module allows users to edit pricing 
records and save changes to the database.

All these workflows are based on API CRUD operation. For simplicity purpose, it has been developed using .NET Core Web API 
Framework using Repository pattern but can be scalable and migrated to different module segregation if more factors and
criteria get involved.

N.B: 
This context diagram is a high-level representation of the system, and does not show any external entities that 
might interact with the Pricing Feed System, such as other systems, users, or devices.
