At high level if we visualize the solution architecture of the e2e application, it should consist of a data ingestion 
component, a storage layer, a data processing component, a data access component, an analytics component, a security 
component, a monitoring and alerting component, and a scalability component.


To upload and persist pricing feeds from retail stores using CSV files containing Store ID, SKU, Product Name, Price, 
and Date,a solution architecture that considers the following components is required:

Data Ingestion: 
The solution needs to have a component that can ingest the CSV files containing the pricing feeds. 
This component should be able to read the CSV files from a specific location (e.g., FTP server, S3 bucket),
parse the data, and send it to the storage layer.

Storage: 
The pricing feeds need to be stored in a database that can handle large volumes of data and is scalable.
A NoSQL database such as MongoDB or CosmosDB would be a good choice for this use case. But for relational model,
SQL can be used with proper indexing & execution plan.

Data Processing: 
The solution should have a component that can process the pricing feeds and perform the necessary transformations 
on the data. This component should be able to clean the data, validate it, and perform any necessary calculations.

Data Access: 
A component that allows users to query the pricing feeds stored in the database should be included in the solution. 
This component could be a web application or an API that allows users to query the data based on different criteria
such as date range, store ID, or SKU.

Analytics:
The solution should include a component that allows users to analyze the pricing feeds data. This component could be 
a dashboard that provides visualizations and insights into the data.

Security: 
The solution should have proper security measures in place to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify 
the pricing feeds data. Access control mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, and encryption should be
implemented.

Monitoring and Alerting:
The solution should have monitoring and alerting mechanisms in place to detect any issues with data ingestion, 
processing, or storage. This component should provide real-time notifications to the appropriate personnel so that 
they can take corrective actions immediately.

Scalability: 
The solution should be designed to handle large volumes of data and be able to scale horizontally or vertically as 
needed.

***************************************
High level solution architecture for search and edit pricing records, we need to consider--

Data Storage: 
A database system must be chosen to store the pricing records. A relational database system such as 
PostgreSQL or SQL Server is a good choice for this task.

Backend Services:
The backend of the system should provide APIs to allow users to search and modify pricing records. 
APIs can be developed using programming languages such as .NET, Golang, or Node.js.

Frontend Application:
A user interface must be designed to interact with the backend system. This can be achieved by developing a 
web-based application or a desktop application using frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.

Search Criteria: 
The search functionality should allow users to search for pricing records using various criteria such as 
product name, product category, price range, or any other relevant criteria. This can be achieved by providing a 
search form with fields corresponding to each search criterion.

Editing and Saving: 
Once the user finds the desired pricing record, the system should allow them to edit and save changes. 
This can be achieved by providing a form to modify the fields of the pricing record and a button to save changes 
to the database.

Authentication and Authorization: 
To ensure the security of the system, it is important to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms 
to control access to pricing records. This can be achieved by implementing a user login system with role-based 
access control.


So. it requires the integration of a database system, backend services, a frontend application, search criteria, 
editing and saving functionality, authentication and authorization.
